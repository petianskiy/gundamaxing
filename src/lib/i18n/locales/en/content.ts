  "faq.q1": "What is Gundamaxing?",
  "faq.a1": "Gundamaxing is a community platform for Gunpla (Gundam plastic model) builders to showcase their work, share techniques, track build lineage, and connect with other builders worldwide.",
  "faq.q2": "Do I need an account to browse builds?",

  "faq.q3": "What is a Build Passport?",
  "faq.a3": "A Build Passport is a detailed page for each build that includes photos, techniques used, paint systems, tools, build logs, and an intent statement from the builder. Think of it as a living portfolio entry.",
  "faq.q4": "What is Build DNA?",
  "faq.a4": "Build DNA tracks the creative lineage of builds. When you fork a build, it creates a link showing how one builder's work inspired another. Over time this creates a visual family tree of custom interpretations.",
  "faq.q5": "How does the verification system work?",
  "faq.a5": "Builds can earn verification tiers — Verified, Featured, and Master — based on community engagement, build quality, and builder reputation. Higher tiers unlock badges and increased visibility in the feed.",
  "faq.q6": "What grades and scales are supported?",
  "faq.a6": "We support all Bandai grades: HG, RG, MG, PG, SD, RE/100, FM, EG, MGEX, and HiRM. Scales include 1/144, 1/100, 1/60, and Non-scale.",
  "faq.q7": "Can I sell kits on Gundamaxing?",
  "faq.a7": "The Trading Post forum category allows buying, selling, and trading kits and supplies between community members. All transactions happen directly between users — Gundamaxing does not process payments.",
  "faq.q8": "How do I report inappropriate content?",
  "faq.a8": "Use the report button on any build, comment, or forum post. Our moderation team reviews reports within 24 hours. See our Guidelines page for what constitutes a violation.",
  "faq.q9": "Is Gundamaxing affiliated with Bandai?",
  "faq.a9": "No. Gundamaxing is an independent fan community. We are not affiliated with Bandai Namco, Sunrise, or any official Gundam properties. All kit names and trademarks belong to their respective owners.",
